    <h1>Python Lesson 1</h1>
    <h2>Data Types</h2>

    <h3>Objectives:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To familiarize students with the basic concepts of programming and the
        Python programming language.
      </li>
      <li>
        To understand and use basic data types, variables and operations in
        Python.
      </li>
      <li>To write simple programs in Python.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A "Data Type" is simply a classification of information. The data type of
      an object dictates the different things that we can do to it and use it
      for.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Python there are many different data types but the ones we are going to
      talk about now are the following:
    </p>

    <h4>Integer</h4>
    <p>
      In python integers are represented by the keyword "int". Int's are any
      whole number (negative or positive).
    </p>

    <h4>Float</h4>
    <p>
      In python floats are represented by the keyword "float". Floats's are any
      decimal number (negative or positive).
    </p>

    <h4>String</h4>
    <p>
      In python strings are represented by the keyword "str". Str's are any
      anything surrounded by double quotes ("im a string") or single quotes ('i
      am also a string').
    </p>

    <h4>Boolean</h4>
    <p>
      In python boolean's are represented by the keyword "bool". Bools are
      either True or False (Capitals Matter!).
    </p>

    <pre>
<code># Examples
1, 3, 5, 9, -3, 0 #  Integers
1.0, 0.9, -0.7, 5.6, 8.0 #  Floats (Decimals)
"hello", "0.2", '-98', 'True' #  Strings
True, False #  Boolean
</code>
    </pre>

    <h3>Task 1:</h3>
    <p>To create a variable, you use the = symbol.</p>

    <pre>
<code># Example
name = value
</code>
    </pre>

    <ol>
      <li>create a variable called "name" and give it a string value.</li>
    </ol>
