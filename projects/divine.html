      <h2>Chapter 1 | Faded</h2>
      <p>
        The wind swirled around me, and the world went black. I was transported
        my bedroom. It was all a dream. The time was 4:20 pm. How did I sleep
        for so long? I went down to make food, as my stomach grumbled grumpily.
        My house was eerily quiet. A gentle whistle was the only thing delaying
        the rule of total silence. I ventured upstairs, on a quest to find signs
        of life. I entered the masters bedroom and saw a lifeless body, covered
        in a coat of blood and debris. Blood dripped down to form a trickle. My
        heart skipped a beat. I darted off to my room to dial 999. A hooded
        figure emerged from my wardrobe. “Come to me, and you will perish. Come
        to me or suffer pain like never before!”, he said. I hesitated. I
        reached for my phone. I felt my insides explode. I woke up. I wasn’t
        home. I was in a forest, but it felt different, like I could hear the
        forest. I noticed with strange imprints on my limbs. I realised they’re
        on my whole body. My clothes were torn apart. I noticed robes forming
        from thin air. They were perfectly my size. There was a note. <br />
        <br />

          These clothes are made from a magical fibre. As long as you wear
          these, you can channel your inner powers. You are what’s known as a
          Divine, a person with special powers. These markings are a sign. You
          are special. You are immortal until you are ready to go. Take these
          clothes and wear them. They will adapt to whatever situation you need.
          Put the rings on your fingers. They will allow you to use spells and
          enchantments. The man that tried to kill you was Tupuna. He is not a
          divine, he doesn’t have your powers. He stole the powers by stealing
          them from another Divine. They are what’s known as soulers. They have
          split the soul of a Divine and made it live within him using a potion.
          Although us divines live in secrecy, he is well trained in our arts
          and knows how to obtain our powers. You must defeat him. <br />

        I adorned the robes and rings. The rings embedded themselves into my
        hand, and a large gem appeared on the back of my hand. My clothes
        sparked with light.
