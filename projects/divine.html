      <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
      <h2>The Begining</h2>
      <p>
        The wind swirled around me, and the world went black. I was transported
        my bedroom. It was all a dream. The time was 4:20 pm. How did I sleep
        for so long? I went down to make food, as my stomach grumbled grumpily.
        My house was eerily quiet. A gentle whistle was the only thing delaying
        the rule of total silence. I ventured upstairs, on a quest to find signs
        of life. I entered the master bedroom and saw a lifeless body, covered
        in a coat of blood and debris. Blood dripped down to form a trickle. My
        heart skipped a beat. I darted off to my room to dial 999. A hooded
        figure emerged from my wardrobe. “Come to me, or you will perish. Come
        to me or suffer pain like never before!”, he said. I hesitated. I
        reached for my phone. I felt my insides explode. <br />
        I woke up. I wasn’t home. I was in a forest, but it felt different, like
        I could hear the forest. I noticed with strange imprints on my limbs. I
        realised they’re on my whole body. My clothes were torn apart. I noticed
        robes forming from thin air. They were perfectly my size. There was a
        note. <br />
        <br />
        <span class="note">
          These clothes are made from a magical fibre. As long as you wear
          these, you can channel your inner powers. You are what’s known as a
          Divine, a person with special powers. These markings are a sign. You
          are special. You are immortal until you are ready to go. Take these
          clothes and wear them. They will adapt to whatever situation you need.
          Put the rings on your fingers. They will allow you to use spells and
          enchantments. The man that tried to kill you was Tupuna. He is not a
          divine, he doesn’t have your powers. He stole the powers by stealing
          them from another Divine. They are what’s known as soulers. They have
          split the soul of a Divine and made it live within him using a potion.
          Although us divines live in secrecy, he is well trained in our arts
          and knows how to obtain our powers. You must defeat him. <br />

        I adorned the robes and rings. The rings embedded themselves into my
        hand, and a large gem appeared on the back of my hand. My clothes
        sparked with light. My clothes turned from a washed out tan to a lilac,
        with matching markings. I realised I didn't know the way out. Dusk had
        arrived and I had no way out. Suddenly, a trail of purple lights
        revealed itself, casting a guiding glow. My instincts were telling me to
        follow it. After a short while, I arrive at the outskirts of my village.
        <br />
        “Don’t go there. Its too dangerous”, a voice inside my head said. <br />
        I went to my house only to see it destroyed. <br />
        “Run” a voice in my head hissed. <br />
        I ran Into the forest to seek shelter. After I ran deep enough, I fall
        to the ground from exhaustion. <br />
        “Keep running” the voice said. <br />
        I leaped up and dashed away Into the heart of the forest. Is I was
        walking through the tries, I saw one glowing purple. I walked towards
        it. I noticed a line of braided vine. I grabbed Into It and It engulfed
        my hand. Then, the rope ascended Into the canopies of the trees. I saw
        an Interconnected set of rope bridges. This was my new home. I entered a
        cabin that dangled from a branch higher up. I entered and there was
        everything I needed. I found another note. As a divine, you don’t get
        tired. Your brain got used to being tired before you became divine.
        There is no point being tired. As a divine, you eat different things
        that as human. You only need light from the moon. As a divine, you are
        not human. You can shift into any form you want. A Divine’s natural form
        is light, but as you came from human form yours is human. You can still
        shift, but your body needs to adapt to these divine powers. In these
        trees is your house. Don’t ever go to humans in your human form. Shift
        into a bird or other animal. Your robes can also bend light around you,
        making you invisible.
        <br />
        <br /><span class="note">
          You can find everything you need. For food you must hunt the wild
          life. You cannot go to humans as Tupuna will find you. This forest is
          where you are the safest. There are protective enchantments protecting
          you. Ones Soulers can’t break through.

        I climbed into my new bed. I descended into the dreamy abyss of slumber.

      <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
      <h2>The Hunt</h2>
      <p>
        When I woke up, I went out into the fresh air. The rain relieved me of
        the Immense heat. I went over to a tree and picked up a glowing bow. I
        found large eagle wings on my back. They also shared the Divine
        Markings. As I leapt of the edge of a path, I felt the strength of my
        wings keep me floating. I hear some noises. A deer runs across. Then I
        hear people talking. “Where is she? She was last seen in here.” I heard
        a man saying. “I don’t know. We must be careful.” Another said. I stood
        there and watched. “Kill them,” a voice hissed inside my head. I saw an
        arrow form from thin air. It levitated until I grabbed it. I pointed the
        tip of my arrow and one of the men and pulled on the bowstring. I did
        archery when I was younger. When I had a head shot, I let the muscles in
        my hand release, Pushing the arrow into the air, hurtling at the men.
        Bullseye. He dropped to the floor. The arrow zoomed back into my hand,
        ready to pierce the skull of the other. I took aim and fired. Both dead.
        I noticed another note rise from ashes.
        <br /><br /><span class="note">
          You can cause fire to erupt from your hands. Burn the bodies. No-one
          can know. They’re on to you. Get out of there and travel far. <br />
