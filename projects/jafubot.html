      <h1>JaFuBot</h1>

      <p>
        JafuBot is a Discord bot that I made for my server. It has a variety of
        commands, including moderation, fun, and utility commands. It also has a
        leveling system, which is currently in beta. It is written in Javascript
        using the discord.js library.
